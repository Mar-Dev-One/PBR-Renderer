// chair leg) is commonly placed many times by different scene nodes: the
// geometry is uploaded once, and each placement is one lightweight
// submesh entry. For .obj there is simply one mesh + one identity-transform
// submesh per material.

// mask/blend, double-sided materials and emissive strength.
