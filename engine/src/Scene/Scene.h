// A flat list of placed things -- models, lights, cameras -- each with its
// own local transform and an optional parent. Lets an app build a scene out
// of model_load()'d models and light_init_*()'d lights instead of wiring
// loose fields together by hand every frame (which is what testbed/main.c
// did before this: one scene_model, one light_dir/light_color pair, one
// camera, all separate struct members with no shared representation).
//
// Deliberately a flat array + parent index, not a tree of heap nodes:
// cache-friendly to walk in scene_update_world_transforms() / the
// scene_draw_* helpers below, and entities are never moved once added
// (index-stable for the scene's lifetime), so a parent index stays valid
// for as long as the scene exists. There is no entity removal yet --
// see the note on scene_destroy() below.
//
// Ownership: a scene entity BORROWS the model/camera pointer passed to
// scene_add_model() / scene_add_camera(), same as model::default_material
// borrows nothing and model::textures owns everything -- there's no single
// rule, so each type's doc comment says which. Lights are stored by value
// (light is a small POD, nothing to own). Callers are still responsible for
// model_load()/model_destroy() and camera_init() themselves; the scene only
// records where those things sit.
