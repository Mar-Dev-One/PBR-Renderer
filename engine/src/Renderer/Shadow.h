// Cascaded shadow mapping for the scene's key directional light.
//
// The old approach (a single ortho box, fixed at [-2, 2] on every axis and
// pushed back 6 units along -light_dir) only worked because the demo always
// re-centred whatever model it loaded into a 2-unit cube first
// (model_get_fit_transform() in Scene/Model.h) -- the shadow box was sized
// for that cube, not for a real scene. Anything wider than the cube (the
// ground plane, a second model, a scene that isn't recentred to the origin)
// either fell outside the box (no shadow) or, if the box were just made
// bigger to compensate, every model shrank to a handful of shadow-map
// texels regardless of camera distance (blocky shadows up close).
//
// CSM fixes both by tying the shadow box to the *camera* instead of the
// scene: the camera's view frustum is sliced into CSM_MAX_CASCADES depth
// ranges (near cascades small and close -- high texel density where detail
// is visible -- far cascades big and coarse), and each slice gets its own
// tightly-fit ortho box computed fresh every frame from camera.fov/aspect/
// near/far. Scale of the scene no longer matters; only distance from the
// camera does.

// Fixed texture units the cascades live on when bound for drawing.
// Material.h owns 0..4 (MATERIAL_SLOT_COUNT); IBL.h's IBL_SLOT_* start
// right after CSM_SLOT_FIRST..CSM_SLOT_FIRST+CSM_MAX_CASCADES-1 (see that
// header's own comment, updated to match).
