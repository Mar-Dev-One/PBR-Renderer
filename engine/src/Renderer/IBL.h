// Image-based lighting: turns an equirectangular HDR panorama into the things
// a PBR shader needs to light a surface from "everywhere at once", plus a
// skybox to look at it.
//
//   environment  the panorama as a cube map with a mip chain (the sky itself)
//   irradiance   32^2 cube map: diffuse light arriving from each direction
//   prefiltered  128^2 cube map: mip N = the environment blurred by the GGX
//                specular lobe of roughness N / (mip_count - 1)
//   brdf_lut     256^2 RG16F texture: the BRDF half of the split-sum
//                approximation. u = N.V, v = perceptual roughness; R = scale
//                and G = bias applied to F0 (F0 * R + G). It doesn't depend on
//                the panorama, but is baked with the other maps in ibl_create().
//
// Baking happens once, on the GPU, inside ibl_create().

// Texture units the maps live on when bound for drawing. Material.h owns
// 0..4 (MATERIAL_SLOT_COUNT) and Shadow.h's cascades own
// CSM_SLOT_FIRST..CSM_SLOT_FIRST+CSM_MAX_CASCADES-1 (5..8), so IBL starts
// right after those.
